This is some sample data to use with the EXIF importer plugin.

The time offset should be set to "2:00:00", because the pictures are
taken in Sweden (UTC+1) in the summer (+day saving time). The coordinates 
in the GPX file are in the Swedish RT90 grid, so the coordinates in the 
generated GPX file will also be in that grid.
