Climate data processor wizard is a plugin for QGIS (http://qgis.org). Is can also run as a standalone application. The purpose of the climate data processing wizard is to produce climate variable aggregates for use in tools such as openModeller (see http://openmodeller.sf.net). For example, given a set of monthly mean temp and a monthly mean precipitation datasets, you can produce aggregate datasets such as:

- mean precipiation in coolest month
- mean precipitation in warmest quarter

Many different aggregates can be produced in this way (around 36 at last count). The original idea for this application belongs to Dr Peter Brewer, who implemented a similar tool in visual basic. This plugin aims to be a) a  lot faster, b) integrate with QGIS and c) provide a more flexible & cross platform application architecture. The plugin can read in a number of specialised climatology formats such as Hadley models, and can also read in any GDAL (http://gdal.org) supported raster formats,

One of the main goals of this tool is to remove the effects of seasonal offsets between hemispheres (where seasons in the southern hemisphere are shifted 6 months away from seasons in northern hemisphere). Not removing these effects often produces undesireable model results.
