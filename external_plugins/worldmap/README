This provides a plug-in for QuantumGIS (http://qgis.sourceforge.net/) for
creating and analyzing feature spaces.

The current version as of 3/10/2004 is 0.0.

You have to hack variable as the top of ``Makefile.am'' to point to the qgis
source hierarchy; eventually this hack will be eliminated when qgis has a
separate library.
