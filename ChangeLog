July 26, 2002
	Drawing code now properly displays layers and calculates extents when
	zooming. Zoom is still fixed zoom in rather than interactive.
July 20, 2002
	Repaint automatic for layers.
July 18, 2002
	Point, line and polygon PostGis layers can be drawn. Still issues with
	map exent and positioning of layers on the canvas. Drawing is manual and
	not tied to the paint event. No zooming or panning yet.
July 10, 2002
	Layers can be selected and added to the map canvas collection however
	the rendering code is currently disabled and being reorganized. So if
	you add a layer, nothing will be drawn...
	
July 6, 2002
	This code is preliminary and really has no true functionality other than
	the ability to define a PostGIS connection and display the spatially enabled
	tables that could be loaded. 

	This is the initial import of the code base into CVS on Sourceforge.net.
