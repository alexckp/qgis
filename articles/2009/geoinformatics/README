We were asked to write an article for Geoinformatics, Magazine for Surveying,
Mapping and GIS Professionals by Eric van Rees <evanrees@geoinformatics.com>.

## Their plan:

"Many thanks for your positive reply! We're looking forward to your
contribution. My plan is to have a series of open source geospatial
application articles in the coming issues of the magazine. If possible, I'd
like to publish your contribution in our March issue (deadline February 4).
As for the contents, maybe you'd be able to do a product review of QGIS v.
1.0 and its users/purpose in life/platforms used?"

## Deadline

Final Deadline is Feb 4 2009. The normal procedure would be that we write the
article and send it to Eric van Rees before the deadline. After that we still
have time for finetuning everything...if we prefer a PDF they can send us one.
