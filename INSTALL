Requirements:
1. PostgreSQL built with the --with-CXX configure options (C++ wrapper)
2. PostGIS support in PostgreSQL
3. Qt 3.0.x built with thread support
4. GDAL/OGR library compiled and installed (with headers). QGIS assumes
   that the headers and library will be in a standard (i.e. /usr/local)
   location. See http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal.
5. Optional - Qt PostgreSQL driver (can be built with Qt or separately
-- see Qt SQL docs)

To build QGIS:
1. Make sure your QTDIR environment variable is set to your Qt directory
2. Set PGSQL environment variable to point to your PostgreSQL installation 
and make sure the libpq++ headers are available in $(PGSQL)/include
3. Build QGIS by typing: make

The QGIS executable (qgis) will be built in the ./qgis/src directory
